# OppenheimerProject

The Oppenheimer Project is a software system that enable Clerks to populate a list of working class heroes to the system, enable Bookkeepers to retrieve the payable taxation relief for each
working class and enable Governor to dispense the money to each working class hero at her discretion.


As the Quality Assurance Engineer of this project, I have come up with the testing strategy mainly foxused on automation testing using Python, Selenium and Robot framework. I have used Pycharm IDE for the implementation and MySQL Workbench for database connectivity. By using those tools and technologies I have performed Unit, Integration, Functional, Non-functional and performance testing.





Here are the small steps you can use to run these tools on your system:

•	Clone or download the project to your machine

•	Open Pycharm or any other IDE e.g: Visual Studio Code

•	Download and install the latest version of Python, Robot framework, Selenium, PyMySql, Requests, Jsonpath etc.

•	Ope your MySQL Workbench and make sure your database is up and running

•	Now in Pycharm, open the terminal and type robot TestCases\* .robot and press enter key (it will run all the test cases with .robot file)
